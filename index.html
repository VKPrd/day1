        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Vivek Kumar, a Computer Science graduate with a deep interest in both hardware and software
            domains of technology. I hail from Madhubani, Bihar, and currently reside in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. I have
            always been passionate about how technology works—from the physical components inside a computer to the
            logic behind a dynamic website. This curiosity has led me to build a diverse skill set that spans across
            hardware troubleshooting, networking configuration, and modern web development.

            From my early days in education, I was always inclined toward understanding how systems functioned. Whether
            it was assembling old desktop computers or configuring LANs in cyber cafés, I found immense joy in
            problem-solving and hands-on experimentation. This foundational interest guided me towards pursuing a B.Tech
            in Computer Science from the Oriental Institute of Science & Technology, Jabalpur. During my academic years,
            I gained not only theoretical knowledge but also practical exposure to various technical aspects of IT
            infrastructure and software development.

            One of my core strengths lies in hardware troubleshooting and networking. I have hands-on experience
            assembling and disassembling PCs, setting up dual-boot operating systems, and configuring LAN/WAN networks.
            My familiarity with tools like routers and switches, along with an understanding of IP configuration and
            subnetting, gives me confidence to work in real-world networking environments. I have also established my
            own home lab where I practice VLAN setups, OS installations, and PC configurations. This practice has helped
            me not just understand hardware but also strengthened my grasp of how networks function and interact.

            Parallel to my hardware knowledge, I’ve actively been learning front-end web development. With the world
            rapidly moving toward digital solutions, I wanted to upskill myself in software development to broaden my
            career possibilities. I began by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building simple static websites and
            experimenting with different layouts, animations, and responsive designs. Over time, I moved on to React.js,
            a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Although I consider myself a learner in React,
            I’ve already built mini projects like a to-do list app and am currently working on a personal portfolio
            website.

            In terms of tools, I am proficient with Visual Studio Code, Git, and the overall development workflow that
            involves writing code, version control, and basic debugging. My aim is to grow into a full-stack developer,
            someone who understands not just how code works, but how it interacts with hardware and networks as well.
            This full-circle understanding makes me unique among many other candidates who are usually focused on just
            one domain.

            To support my technical education, I have also pursued certifications that validate my skills. I’ve
            completed training for Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), which introduced me to enterprise-grade
            networking solutions. I have also taken part in a front-end certification program with CodeYogi, where I was
            trained in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I consistently follow self-learning paths through
            platforms like YouTube, freeCodeCamp, and MDN Web Docs to keep updating my skills.

            Soft skills are equally important in the professional world, and I take pride in being a quick learner, team
            player, and effective communicator. My peers often commend my ability to break down complex problems into
            manageable solutions. Whether working in a team or independently, I always strive to deliver results and
            continuously learn from feedback. I am fluent in English, Hindi, and Maithili, which allows me to
            collaborate with diverse teams and connect with a wider audience.

            In the near future, my goal is to secure an entry-level position in the IT industry where I can apply both
            my hardware and software skills. I am particularly interested in roles that involve IT support, front-end
            development, or system administration. I believe that my ability to understand how software interacts with
            physical systems makes me a versatile candidate capable of adapting to different roles and responsibilities.

            I am also passionate about lifelong learning. Technology evolves rapidly, and I want to evolve with it.
            Whether it's learning a new JavaScript framework, understanding cybersecurity concepts, or exploring cloud
            platforms like AWS, I am always ready to take the next step in my learning journey.

            To conclude, I see myself as a multi-dimensional tech enthusiast who bridges the gap between hardware
            infrastructure and modern web technologies. I believe that my blended skill set, proactive learning
            attitude, and strong foundational knowledge make me a valuable addition to any forward-thinking
            organization.

            If you're looking for someone who is enthusiastic, dedicated, and ready to contribute from day one—while
            continuously learning and growing—then I could be a great fit for your team.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>1. Home Networking Lab
                As a technology enthusiast with a strong interest in hardware and networking, I took the initiative to
                set up my own Home Networking Lab to practically apply the theoretical knowledge I gained during my
                B.Tech studies and CCNA training.

                In this lab, I independently configured a Local Area Network (LAN) setup that included multiple PCs,
                routers, and switches. I practiced essential network configurations such as IP addressing, subnetting,
                and VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) implementation. One of my main objectives was to understand how
                devices communicate across networks and how data packets are routed within a LAN or across WANs.

                I also experimented with dual-boot system installations, installing both Windows and Linux operating
                systems on a single machine. This helped me understand the structure of bootloaders (like GRUB),
                partitioning schemes, and the difference in system behavior across OS platforms. I regularly practiced
                assembling and disassembling PCs to improve my hardware troubleshooting skills, learning how to identify
                and fix common hardware issues such as faulty RAM, hard disk errors, or overheating problems.

                This home lab has not only strengthened my practical knowledge but also taught me how to document
                configurations, troubleshoot real-world problems, and maintain system performance—all crucial skills for
                IT support and network administration roles.

                2. Web Development Practice Projects
                Parallel to my interest in hardware, I’ve been actively learning front-end web development to build a
                more versatile skill set that includes both software and network expertise. I began with the basics:
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through self-paced learning via platforms like YouTube, freeCodeCamp, and
                CodeYogi, I built several practice projects to enhance my understanding of UI/UX principles, responsive
                design, and DOM manipulation.

                One of my first projects was a responsive personal portfolio website, which includes sections like About
                Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact Form. This project helped me understand responsive design using media
                queries and grid/flexbox layouts for clean, mobile-friendly user interfaces.

                Another major learning project was a To-Do List Application created using JavaScript. In this project, I
                implemented features such as task addition, deletion, local storage integration (to save tasks even
                after the browser is closed), and simple data validation. This helped me grasp event handling,
                function-based logic, and state management at a basic level.

                Currently, I am learning React.js and converting my basic JavaScript projects into React components. For
                instance, I am transforming my to-do list project into a fully functional React app using useState,
                props, and JSX syntax. These projects are being hosted on GitHub, and I continue to update them as I
                learn more.

                Together, these two project areas—networking hardware and web development—highlight my commitment to
                becoming a well-rounded IT professional. They demonstrate not just my ability to follow tutorials but to
                apply, experiment, and build systems independently. This hands-on experience is something I look forward
                to applying in a real-world organizational setting.</p>
